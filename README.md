# Ultimate Reversi
Reversi is a popular board game. This project was made by me in 2010 for my Bachelor's Thesis Defence. It was made on C++ in Dev-C++ IDE and "Allegro" game buiding library. 
It has some bugs and it crashes sometimes but I have never really finished it. AI is quite simple but it works.
To the repository I also attached my Bachelor's Thesis Defence as well. It's in Polish though.

To start the Game - run Ultimate Reversi.exe file under //Reversi 1.0/
